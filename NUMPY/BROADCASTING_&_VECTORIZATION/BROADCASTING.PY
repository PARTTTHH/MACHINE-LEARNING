"""BROADCASTING IS A MECHANISM IN NUMPY THAT ALLOWS ARRAYS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES
TO PERFORM MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS BY AUTOMATICALLY ADJESTING THEIR DIAMENSIONS

RULES : 
    1.COMPARE SHAPES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
    2.DIMENSIONS ARE COMPATIBLE IF :-
            -THEY ARE EQUAL OR
            -ONE OF THEM IS 1
            -IF NOT --> ERROR OCCURS 
    IN BELOW EXAMPLES, 1 WE SEE THERE WE HAVE ARR A ONE-D ARRAY AND ARR2 WITH ONLY ONE ELEMENT
    NUMPY EXPLANDS ARR2 MEANS [2] = [2,2,2] TO MATHCH THE DIMENSION OF ARR AND THEN PERFORM FOLLOWING 
    OPERATION WITHOUT LOOP AND FAST

    EXAMPLE 2 THERE WE HAVE ARR3 IS A 1-D ARRAY WITH LINE OF ELEMENTS AND SECONF ONE ARR4 IS A 
    2-D ARRAY THERE WE HAVE A COLUMN OF ELEMENTS. IN THIS EXMPLE BROACASTING EXPANDS BOTH ARRAY 
    INTO 2-D ARRAY WITH SAME ELEMENTS WITHOUT CHANGING DATA AND THEN PERFORM FOLLOWING OPERATION AND 
    GIVE A RESULT WITHOU LOOPS AND FASTER
    
    EXAMPLE 3 THERE WE4 HAVE AGAIN TWO ARRAY ARR5 AND ARR6 THERE WE HAVE BOTH ARRAY 1-D ARAYS BUT 
    IN ARR5 WE HAVE 3 ELEMENTS BUT IN ARR6 WE HAVE ONLY TWO ELEMENTS SO IN THIS CASE BROADCASSTING GET CONFUSED
    AND UNABLE TO ADJEST THERE DIMENSIONS SO THIS ONE IS NOT ALLOWED IN BROADCASTING THATS WHY
    NUMPY THOWS ERROR:-  operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,) (2,)
